# Fix broken systems
We want to fix systems- even if that means throwing them away and rebuilding them- not condemn individuals.

## Why?
The Austin Police Department (APD) response to the opening weekend of the George Floyd protests was abhorrent. A number of peaceful protesters were shot with rubber bullets. Four of them were critically wounded. One of them, Brad Levi Ayala, was particularly brutal. On a hill stands a young man- perfectly still in the video. He is no less than 20 feet from anyone else. A line of police in riot gear stands maybe 40 feet away. One officer raises a shotgun to his shoulder and fires a beanbag round straight into the boy’s forehead.

Some people are very angry with the police. We have a place for that. Some want to cause violence or destruction. We *do not* have space for that.

When pushing for a change, it’s important that we don’t mix messages. This particular effort concerns how police are disciplined and is not an alternative to creating new systems of public service. It is also not an alternative to [decreasing the police budget](https://www.kxan.com/austin-george-floyd-mike-ramos-protests/mayor-adler-not-ready-to-support-initiative-to-defund-apd-by-100-million/), an effort currently spearheaded within city government by Council Member Greg Casar and Mayor Pro Tem Delia Garza/

We can organize around a similar voice that sounds something like this:

> I know awful things happen. I don’t expect that there are no bad apples in APD- ever. The provisions we are fighting against seem to protect primarily bad actors. While bad things happen, we must change or disassemble systems that allow patterns of misbehavior. We must protect the good police officers from those acting poorly. Don’t let the bad apples spoil the bunch.

What’s done is done. We can't change that. This message allows those responsible to save face as long as they fix the system.

## Our public comment effort
We want changes to the police union contract titled [“AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF AUSTIN AND THE AUSTIN POLICE ASSOCIATION EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 15, 2018.”](https://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=310410)

No one I know is experienced at lobbying. We will be figuring out how to lobby as we go. Because of Covid, we cannot attend city council meetings in person. Austin City Council hosts [General Citizen Communication meetings](https://austintexas.gov/content/2020-general-citizen-communication-schedule) regularly. As of this writing, the next public signup date is 7/9 for the 7/30 meeting. Put a reminder on your calendar right now for 9am on 7/9. I’ll wait.

We will seek opportunities to partner with other grassroots organizations where our values are aligned.

It is also understood and agreed that if the Chief permits the use of vacation days for suspension, such days off shall be considered as equal punishment to traditional unpaid days of suspension. 

**Impact:** *Allows officers to use discretionary time to pay themselves while on unpaid suspension* 
#### Article 18 Section 1.a.1

## What else can I do?
Keep an eye on city hall news. If you find out about an emergency meeting that is taking public comment, please let me know. One occurred about one week into the George Floyd protests and a lot of good came from it. There was a lot of emotion, but not a lot of specific action being requested by residents other than a vague notion of sweeping changes.

If you are aware of other groups organizing for similar changes, please raise it to me and we can see about rolling our groups into one. The more people pushing for a singular set of changes, the more likely we will have positive results.

If you know of more urgent city code changes or have other issues with the police union contract, please let me know.
